# Hi everyone! 👋

> A quick introduction about me

Hi, I'm __Gabriel__ a Software and Data Engineer settled in a little village in the north of Burgos, Spain ⛰️ I love programming and making open source projects (🧙‍♂️ open sourcerer).

I'm mainly interested in Machine Learning 🧠, MLOps, Microservices and DevOps 👷, so you will find me in my spare time developing or contributing to things related to these fields. From time to time, I also like to write frontend code.
