# Hi everyone! 👋

> A quick introduction about me

Hi, I'm __Gabriel__ a Machine Learning Engineer who loves programming and making open source projects (🧙‍♂️ open sourcerer).

I'm mainly interested in Software Engineering, Machine Learning 🧠, MLOps, Microservices and DevOps 👷, so you will find me in my spare time developing or contributing to things related to these fields. From time to time, I also like to write frontend code.
